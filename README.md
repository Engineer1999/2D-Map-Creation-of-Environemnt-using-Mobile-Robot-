# 2D-Map-Creation-of-Environemnt-using-Mobile-Robot
Aim of this project is to develop an working model of a mobile car which can go travel therough a remote area and send the data wirelessly
to the main server by which a 2-D map of that environment will be created. 
To scan the surronding we have use 3 ultrasonic sensors and collected data is transmitted by a nrf240 wireless module.
